**Brought Up**

In the context of the UK Parliament, "brought up" refers to the introduction of a new clause or amendment to a Bill for consideration. It signifies that the item is now officially on the table for discussion. 



**Question Put**

"Question put" then follows, indicating that the Speaker or chair has formally presented this new clause or amendment to the House for a decision. This is the stage where members decide whether to accept or reject the proposed addition to the Bill, leading to a division (vote) if there's disagreement or the need for a formal vote. These terms are part of the procedural language used in parliamentary debates and proceedings, which follows a traditional and formal structure.
